        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring is used during delivery for fetal well-being assessment. Classically
            based on the visual evaluation of FIGO criteria, FHR characterization remains a challenging task that
            continuously receives intensive research efforts. Intrapartum FHR analysis is further complicated by
            the two different stages of labor (dilation and active pushing). Research works aimed at devising
            automated acidosis prediction procedures are either based on designing new advanced signal
            processing analyses or on efficiently combining a large number of features proposed in the literature.
            Such multi-feature procedures either rely on a prior feature selection step or end up with decision
            rules involving long lists of features. This many-feature outcome rule does not permit to easily
            interpret the decision and is hence not well suited for clinical practice. Machine-learning-based
            decision-rule assessment is often impaired by the use of different, proprietary and small databases,
            preventing meaningful comparisons of results reported in the literature. Here, sparse learning is
            promoted as a way to perform jointly feature selection and acidosis prediction, hence producing an
            optimal decision rule based on as few features as possible. Making use of a set of 20 features (gathering
            ‘FIGO-like’ features, classical spectral features and recently proposed scale-free features), applied to
            two large-size (respectively ;1800 and ;500 subjects), well-documented databases, collected
            independently in French and Czech hospitals, the benefits of sparse learning are quantified in terms of:
            (i) accounting for class imbalance (few acidotic subjects), (ii) producing simple and interpretable
            decision rules, (iii) evidences for differences between the temporal dynamics of active pushing and
            dilation stages, and (iv) of validity/generalizability of decision rules learned on one database and
            applied to the other one.

        </p>

        <h2>Database</h2>

        <p>Two independent large-size databases are used. They were
            collected—with different technologies and constraints—at academic hospitals in Lyon,
            France (LDB), and Brno, Czech Republic (CTU-UHB). They share comparable clinical
            characteristics.
            Tracings were included according to clinical and data-quality
            criteria (Doret et al. 2011, Spilka et al. 2017): gestational
            age >= 37 weeks, maternal age >= 18, tracing ending less than 20 minutes before delivery,
            after-delivery pH measurement available, less than 50% of missing data in either labour stage
        </p>

        <h2>CTU-UHB database - results on 552 cases</h2>

        <p> In the paper the subjects were selected based on the data quality at the end of first stage
            and second stage: <strong>i) tracing ending less than 20 minutes before delivery,
                ii) less than 50% of missing data in either labour stage.</strong></p>

        <p>The goal was to explore the benefits of sparse learning in the construction
            of decision rules. The actual computation of usable features required a decent data quality.
            Therefore, to avoid the mixing of two independent
            issues : i) benefits of sparse learning ii) impacts of the quality of the data, we have decided to focus on the first issue
            mostly avoiding the blurring of conclusions on benefits of sparse learning by data quality issues.
            However, to <strong>ease comparison of future works we present here results on the full CTU-UHB database (552 subjects).</strong>
        </p>

        <p>To compute the performance on the full database we have selected the last 20 minutes with FHR quality above 50%.
            We used the <strong>stage I model (SI)</strong> for records ending in the first stage of labour and <strong>stage II model (SII)</strong> for
            records ending in the second stage.</p>
