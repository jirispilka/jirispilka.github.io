  abstract = {Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring is used during delivery for fetal well-being assessment. Classically based on the visual evaluation of FIGO criteria, FHR characterization remains a challenging task that continuously receives intensive research efforts. Intrapartum FHR analysis is further complicated by the two different stages of labor (dilation and active pushing). Research works aimed at devising automated acidosis prediction procedures are either based on designing new advanced signal processing analyses or on efficiently combining a large number of features proposed in the literature. Such multi-feature procedures either rely on a prior feature selection step or end up with decision rules involving long lists of features. This many-feature outcome rule does not permit to easily interpret the decision and is hence not well suited for clinical practice. Machine-learning-based decision-rule assessment is often impaired by the use of different, proprietary and small databases, preventing meaningful comparisons of results reported in the literature. Here, sparse learning is promoted as a way to perform jointly feature selection and acidosis prediction, hence producing an optimal decision rule based on as few features as possible. Making use of a set of 20 features (gathering ‘FIGO-like’ features, classical spectral features and recently proposed scale-free features), applied to two large-size (respectively ≃1800 and ≃500 subjects), well-documented databases, collected independently in French and Czech hospitals, the benefits of sparse learning are quantified in terms of: (i) accounting for class imbalance (few acidotic subjects), (ii) producing simple and interpretable decision rules, (iii) evidences for differences between the temporal dynamics of active pushing and dilation stages, and (iv) of validity/generalizability of decision rules learned on one database and applied to the other one.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This paper details the process of mining information from a hospital information system that has been designed approximately 15 years ago. The information is distributed within database tables in large textual attributes with a free structure. Information retrieval from these information is necessary for complementing cardiotocography signals with additional information that is to be implemented in a decision support system. The basic statistical overview (n-gram analysis) helped with the insight into data structure, however more sophisticated methods have to be used as human (and expert) processing of the whole data were out of consideration: over 620,000 text fields contained text reports in natural language with (many) typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities, syntax errors and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. There was a strong need to efficiently determine the overall structure of the database and discover information that is important from the clinical point of view. We have used three different methods: k-means, self-organizing map and a self-organizing approach inspired by ant-colonies that performed clustering of the records. The records were visualized and revealed the most prominent information structure(s) that were consulted with medical experts and served for further mining from the database. The outcome of this task is a set of ordered or nominal attributes with a structural information that is available for rule discovery mining and automated processing for the research of asphyxia prediction during delivery. The proposed methodology has significantly reduced the processing time of loosely structured textual records for both \{IT\} and medical experts. },

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Cardiotocography (CTG) is a monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Since 1960 it is routinely used by obstetricians to assess fetal well-being. Many attempts to introduce methods of automatic signal processing and evaluation have appeared during the last 20 years, however still no significant progress similar to that in the domain of adult heart rate variability, where open access databases are available (e.g. MIT-BIH), is visible. Based on a thorough review of the relevant publications, presented in this paper, the shortcomings of the current state are obvious. A lack of common ground for clinicians and technicians in the field hinders clinically usable progress. Our open access database of digital intrapartum cardiotocographic recordings aims to change that.DESCRIPTION:The intrapartum CTG database consists in total of 552 intrapartum recordings, which were acquired between April 2010 and August 2012 at the obstetrics ward of the University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. All recordings were stored in electronic form in the OB TraceVue(R);system. The recordings were selected from 9164 intrapartum recordings with clinical as well as technical considerations in mind. All recordings are at most 90 minutes long and start a maximum of 90 minutes before delivery. The time relation of CTG to delivery is known as well as the length of the second stage of labor which does not exceed 30 minutes. The majority of recordings (all but 46 cesarean sections) is - on purpose - from vaginal deliveries. All recordings have available biochemical markers as well as some more general clinical features. Full description of the database and reasoning behind selection of the parameters is presented in the paper.CONCLUSION:A new open-access CTG database is introduced which should give the research community common ground for comparison of results on reasonably large database. We anticipate that after reading the paper, the reader will understand the context of the field from clinical and technical perspectives which will enable him/her to use the database and also understand its limitations.},

The workshop included a series of lectures and discussions focusing on: new algorithms and techniques for cardiotocogoraphy (CTG) and electrocardiogram acquisition and analyses; the results of a CTG evaluation challenge comparing state-of-the-art computerized methods and visual interpretation for the detection of arterial cord pH <7.05 at birth; the lack of consensus about the role of intrapartum acidemia in the etiology of fetal brain injury; the differences between methods for CTG analysis “mimicking” expert clinicians and those derived from “data-driven” analyses; a critical review of the results from two randomized controlled trials testing the former in clinical practice; and relevant insights from modern physiology-based studies. We concluded that the automated algorithms performed comparably to each other and to clinical assessment of the CTG. However, the sensitivity and specificity urgently need to be improved (both computerized and visual assessment). Data-driven CTG evaluation requires further work with large multicenter datasets based on well-defined labor outcomes. And before first tests in the clinic, there are important lessons to be learnt from clinical trials that tested automated algorithms mimicking expert CTG interpretation. In addition, transabdominal fetal electrocardiogram monitoring provides reliable CTG traces and variability estimates; and fetal electrocardiogram waveform analysis is subject to promising new research. There is a clear need for close collaboration between computing and clinical experts. We believe that progress will be possible with multidisciplinary collaborative research.},

  abstract = {Cardiotocography (CTG) is a standard tool for the assessment of fetal well-being during pregnancy and delivery. However, its interpretation is associated with high inter- and intra-observer variability. Since its introduction there have been numerous attempts to develop computerized systems assisting the evaluation of the CTG recording. Nevertheless these systems are still hardly used in a delivery ward. Two main approaches to computerized evaluation are encountered in the literature; the first one emulates existing guidelines, while the second one is more of a data-driven approach using signal processing and computational methods. The latter employs preprocessing, feature extraction/selection and a classifier that discriminates between two or more classes/conditions. These classes are often formed using the umbilical cord artery pH value measured after delivery. In this work an approach to Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) classification using pH is presented that could serve as a benchmark for reporting results on the unique open-access CTU-UHB CTG database, the largest and the only freely available database of this kind. The overall results using a very small number of features and a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier, are in accordance to the ones encountered in the literature and outperform the results of a baseline classification scheme proving the utility of using advanced data processing methods. Therefore the achieved results can be used as a benchmark for future research involving more informative features and/or better classification algorithms.},

To do so, a set of features that are usually encountered in FHR analysis as well as features extracted using a variant of symbolic aggregate approximation were projected onto a lower-dimensional space where patterns can easily be discerned. The results show, both in a qualitative and a quantitative manner, that there is high overlap between the classes that are formed using solely the umbilical cord pH information, irrespective of the selected dimensionality reduction method. These findings suggest that there is probably a limit to the performance expectation of the current pH-based systems and that alternative approaches should be also pursued to enhance the utility of computer-based decision support technologies.},

Nevertheless, 40âyears since the introduction of CTG to clinical practice, its evaluation is still challenging with high inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore the development of more objective methods has become an issue of major importance in the field. Unlike the usually proposed approaches to assign classes for classification methods that rely either on biochemical parameters (e.g. pH value) or a simple aggregation of expert judgment, this work investigates the use of an alternative labeling system using latent class analysis (LCA) along with an ordinal classification scheme. The study is performed on a well-documented open-access database, where nine expert obstetricians provided CTG annotations. The LCA is proposed here to produce more objective class labels while the ordinal classification aims to explore the natural ordering, and representation of increased severity, for obtaining the final results. The results are promising suggesting that more effort should be put into this proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is routinely used in clinical practice to help obstetricians assess fetal health status during delivery. However, early detection of fetal acidosis that allows relevant decisions for operative delivery remains a challenging task, receiving considerable attention. This contribution promotes sparse support vector machine classification that permits to select a small number of relevant features and to achieve efficient fetal acidosis detection. A comprehensive set of features is used for FHR description, including enhanced and computerized clinical features, frequency domain, and scaling and multifractal features, all computed on a large (1288 subjects) and well-documented database. The individual performance obtained for each feature independently is discussed first. Then, it is shown that the automatic selection of a sparse subset of features achieves satisfactory classification performance (sensitivity 0.73 and specificity 0.75, outperforming clinical practice). The subset of selected features (average depth of decelerations $textrm {MAD}_{rm dtrd}$, baseline level $beta _0$ , and variability $H$) receives simple interpretation in clinical practice. Intrapartum fetal acidosis detection is improved in several respects: A comprehensive set of features combining clinical, spectral, and scale-free dynamics is used; an original multivariate classification targeting both sparse feature selection and high performance is devised; state-of-the-art performance is obtained on a much larger database than that generally studied with description of common pitfalls in supervised classification performance assessments.},
