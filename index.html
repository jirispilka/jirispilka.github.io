            <p>Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring is used during delivery for fetal well-being assessment. Classically based on the visual evaluation of FIGO criteria, FHR characterization remains a challenging task that continuously receives intensive research efforts. Intrapartum FHR analysis is further complicated by the two different stages of labor (dilation and active pushing). Research works aimed at devising automated acidosis prediction procedures are either based on designing new advanced signal processing analyses or on efficiently combining a large number of features proposed in the literature. Such multi-feature procedures either rely on a prior feature selection step or end up with decision rules involving long lists of features. This many-feature outcome rule does not permit to easily interpret the decision and is hence not well suited for clinical practice. Machine-learning-based decision-rule assessment is often impaired by the use of different, proprietary and small databases, preventing meaningful comparisons of results reported in the literature. Here, sparse learning is promoted as a way to perform jointly feature selection and acidosis prediction, hence producing an optimal decision rule based on as few features as possible. Making use of a set of 20 features (gathering ‘FIGO-like’ features, classical spectral features and recently proposed scale-free features), applied to two large-size (respectively  1800 and  500 subjects), well-documented databases, collected independently in French and Czech hospitals, the benefits of sparse learning are quantified in terms of: (i) accounting for class imbalance (few acidotic subjects), (ii) producing simple and interpretable decision rules, (iii) evidences for differences between the temporal dynamics of active pushing and dilation stages, and (iv) of validity/generalizability of decision rules learned on one database and applied to the other one.</p>

            <p>Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is routinely used in clinical practice to help obstetricians assess fetal health status during delivery. However, early detection of fetal acidosis that allows relevant decisions for operative delivery remains a challenging task, receiving considerable attention. This contribution promotes sparse support vector machine classification that permits to select a small number of relevant features and to achieve efficient fetal acidosis detection. A comprehensive set of features is used for FHR description, including enhanced and computerized clinical features, frequency domain, and scaling and multifractal features, all computed on a large (1288 subjects) and well-documented database. The individual performance obtained for each feature independently is discussed first. Then, it is shown that the automatic selection of a sparse subset of features achieves satisfactory classification performance (sensitivity 0.73 and specificity 0.75, outperforming clinical practice). The subset of selected features (average depth of decelerations textrm MAD _ rm dtrd , baseline level beta _0 , and variability H) receives simple interpretation in clinical practice. Intrapartum fetal acidosis detection is improved in several respects: A comprehensive set of features combining clinical, spectral, and scale-free dynamics is used; an original multivariate classification targeting both sparse feature selection and high performance is devised; state-of-the-art performance is obtained on a much larger database than that generally studied with description of common pitfalls in supervised classification performance assessments.</p>

            <p>Background: The fetal heart rate (FHR) is commonly monitored during labor to detect early fetal acidosis. FHR variability is traditionally investigated using Fourier transform, often with adult predefined frequency band powers and the corresponding LF/HF ratio. However, fetal conditions differ from adults and modify spectrum repartition along frequencies. Aims: This study questions the arbitrariness definition and relevance of the frequency band splitting procedure, and thus of the calculation of the underlying LF/HF ratio, as efficient tools for characterizing intrapartum FHR variability. Study design: The last 30 minutes before delivery of the intrapartum FHR were analyzed. Subjects: Case-control study. A total of 45 singletons divided into two groups based on umbilical cord arterial pH: the Index group with pH ≤ 7.05 (n = 15) and Control group with pH > 7.05 (n = 30). Outcome measures: Frequency band-based LF/HF ratio and Hurst parameter. Results: This study shows that the intrapartum FHR is characterized by fractal temporal dynamics and promotes the Hurst parameter as a potential marker of fetal acidosis. This parameter preserves the intuition of a power frequency balance, while avoiding the frequency band splitting procedure and thus the arbitrary choice of a frequency separating bands. The study also shows that extending the frequency range covered by the adult-based bands to higher and lower frequencies permits the Hurst parameter to achieve better performance for identifying fetal acidosis. Conclusions: The Hurst parameter provides a robust and versatile tool for quantifying FHR variability, yields better acidosis detection performance compared to the LF/HF ratio, and avoids arbitrariness in spectral band splitting and definitions.</p>

            <p>Rationale, aims and objectives: To evaluate obstetricians’ inter- and intra-observer agreement on intrapartum cardiotocogram (CTG) recordings and to examine obstetricians’ evaluations with respect to umbilical artery pH and base deficit. Methods: Nine experienced obstetricians annotated 634 intrapartum CTG recordings. The evaluation of each recording was divided into four steps: evaluation of two 30-minute windows in the first stage of labour, evaluation of one window in the second stage of labour and labour outcome prediction. The complete set of evaluations used for this experiment is available online. The inter- and intra-observer agreement was evaluated using proportion of agreement and kappa coefficient. Clinicians’ sensitivity and specificity was computed with respect to umbilical artery pH, base deficit and to Apgar score at the fifth minute. Results: The overall proportion of agreement between clinicians reached 48% with 95% confidence intervals (CI) (CI: 47-50). Regarding the different classes, proportion of agreement ranged from 57% (CI: 54-60) for normal to 41% (CI: 36-46) for pathological class. The sensitivity of clinicians’ majority vote to objective outcome was 39% (CI: 16-63) for the umbilical artery base deficit and 27% (CI: 16-42) for pH. The specificity was 89% (CI: 86-92) for both types of objective outcome. Conclusions: The reported inter-/intra-observer variability is large and this holds irrespective of clinicians’ experience or work place. The results support the need of modernized guidelines for CTG evaluation and/or objectivization and repeatability by introduction of a computerized approach that could standardize the process of CTG evaluation within the delivery ward.</p>

            <p>The most common approach to assess fetal well-being during delivery is monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contractionsâthe cardiotocogram (CTG). Nevertheless, 40 years since the introduction of CTG to clinical practice, its evaluation is still challenging with high inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore the development of more objective methods has become an issue of major importance in the field. Unlike the usually proposed approaches to assign classes for classification methods that rely either on biochemical parameters (e.g. pH value) or a simple aggregation of expert judgment, this work investigates the use of an alternative labeling system using latent class analysis (LCA) along with an ordinal classification scheme. The study is performed on a well-documented open-access database, where nine expert obstetricians provided CTG annotations. The LCA is proposed here to produce more objective class labels while the ordinal classification aims to explore the natural ordering, and representation of increased severity, for obtaining the final results. The results are promising suggesting that more effort should be put into this proposed approach.</p>

            <p>Interpretation of cardiotocogram (CTG) is a difficult task since its evaluation is complicated by a great inter- and intra-individual variability. Previous studies have predominantly analyzed clinicians’ agreement on CTG evaluation based on quantitative measures (e.g. kappa coefficient) that do not offer any insight into clinical decision making. In this paper we aim to examine the agreement on evaluation in detail and provide data-driven analysis of clinical evaluation. For this study, nine obstetricians provided clinical evaluation of 634 CTG recordings (each ca. 60 min long). We studied the agreement on evaluation and its dependence on the increasing number of clinicians involved in the final decision. We showed that despite of large number of clinicians the agreement on CTG evaluations is difficult to reach. The main reason is inherent inter- and intra-observer variability of CTG evaluation. Latent class model provides better and more natural way to aggregate the CTG evaluation than the majority voting especially for larger number of clinicians. Significant improvement was reached in particular for the pathological evaluation – giving a new insight into the process of CTG evaluation. Further, the analysis of latent class model revealed that clinicians unconsciously use four classes when evaluating CTG recordings, despite the fact that the clinical evaluation was based on FIGO guidelines where three classes are defined.</p>

            <p>BACKGROUND:Cardiotocography (CTG) is a monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Since 1960 it is routinely used by obstetricians to assess fetal well-being. Many attempts to introduce methods of automatic signal processing and evaluation have appeared during the last 20 years, however still no significant progress similar to that in the domain of adult heart rate variability, where open access databases are available (e.g. MIT-BIH), is visible. Based on a thorough review of the relevant publications, presented in this paper, the shortcomings of the current state are obvious. A lack of common ground for clinicians and technicians in the field hinders clinically usable progress. Our open access database of digital intrapartum cardiotocographic recordings aims to change that.DESCRIPTION:The intrapartum CTG database consists in total of 552 intrapartum recordings, which were acquired between April 2010 and August 2012 at the obstetrics ward of the University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic. All recordings were stored in electronic form in the OB TraceVue(R);system. The recordings were selected from 9164 intrapartum recordings with clinical as well as technical considerations in mind. All recordings are at most 90 minutes long and start a maximum of 90 minutes before delivery. The time relation of CTG to delivery is known as well as the length of the second stage of labor which does not exceed 30 minutes. The majority of recordings (all but 46 cesarean sections) is - on purpose - from vaginal deliveries. All recordings have available biochemical markers as well as some more general clinical features. Full description of the database and reasoning behind selection of the parameters is presented in the paper.CONCLUSION:A new open-access CTG database is introduced which should give the research community common ground for comparison of results on reasonably large database. We anticipate that after reading the paper, the reader will understand the context of the field from clinical and technical perspectives which will enable him/her to use the database and also understand its limitations.</p>

            <p>Fetal heart rate (FHR) is used to evaluate fetal well-being and enables clinicians to detect ongoing hypoxia during delivery. Routine clinical evaluation of intrapartum FHR is based on macroscopic morphological features visible to the naked eye. In this paper we evaluated conventional features and compared them to the nonlinear ones in the task of intrapartum FHR classification. The experiments were performed using a database of 217 FHR records with objective annotations, i.e. pH measurement. We have proven that the addition of nonlinear features improves accuracy of classification. The best classification results were achieved using a combination of conventional and nonlinear features with sensitivity of 73.4%, specificity of 76.3%, and F-measure of 71.9%. The best selected nonlinear features were: Lempel Ziv complexity, Sample entropy, and fractal dimension estimated by Higuchi method. Since the results of automatic signal evaluation are easily reproducible, the process of FHR evaluation can become more objective and may enable clinicians to focus on additional non-cardiotocography parameters influencing the fetus during delivery.</p>

            <p>Cardiotocography is the monitoring of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (TOCO), used routinely since the 1960s by obstetricians to detect fetal hypoxia. The evaluation of the FHR in clinical settings is based on an evaluation of macroscopic morphological features and so far has managed to avoid adopting any achievements from the HRV research field. In this work, most of the features utilized for FHR characterization, including FIGO, HRV, nonlinear, wavelet, and time and frequency domain features, are investigated and assessed based on their statistical significance in the task of distinguishing the FHR into three FIGO classes. We assess the features on a large data set (552 records) and unlike in other published papers we use three-class expert evaluation of the records instead of the pH values. We conclude the paper by presenting the best uncorrelated features and their individual rank of importance according to the meta-analysis of three different ranking methods. The number of accelerations and decelerations, interval index, as well as Lempel–Ziv complexity and Higuchi’s fractal dimension are among the top five features.</p>
