I consider myself as a data science generalist. I enjoy finding patterns in data using signal processing and machine learning algorithms.
Most of the time I spent in Python (data processing, transforming data, employing machine learning models, and programming in general).
The rest of the time I spent writing APIs.   

#### Research interests
biomedical signal processing, machine learning, fetal heart rate analysis, and natural language processing
