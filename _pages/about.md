I consider myself as a data science generalist. I enjoy finding patterns in data using signal processing and machine learning algorithms.
Most of the time I spent in Python (data processing, transforming data, employing machine learning models, and programming in general).
The rest of the time I spent writing APIs. 

### research interests
biomedical signal processing, machine learning, classification, fetal heart rate analysis and classification, 
cardiotocography, and natural language processing

### short-bio
I worked as Research and Development Engineer at Cardiology Department ([BTL Medical Technologies CZ](https://www.btlnet.com/)) and implemented signal
processing and classification algorithms for Holter and resting ECG. I have a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Biocybernetics 
from [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) where I had focused mainly on biomedical signal processing and machine learning 
with a bias and passion towards applications to fetal heart rate analysis.
My great pleasure was to teach Artificial Intelligence course for several years.
At present, I enjoy working at [Concerto.ai](http://www.concerto.ai/). We are creating a conversational AI platform that consists of 
several modules such as intent recognition, data mining, search, dialogue management, and analytics.
