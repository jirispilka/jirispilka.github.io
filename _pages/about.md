I'm a research and development engineer at [Concerto.ai](http://www.concerto.ai/). 
We are creating a conversational AI solution that is capable of question answering from structured and unstructured data, appointment booking, and other cool stuff. 

I have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Biocybernetics from [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en) 
where I had focused mainly on signal processing and machine learning with a bias and passion towards applications to fetal heart rate analysis.
I worked as a researcher at the [Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics](http://www.ciirc.cvut.cz/), and I had a pleasure 
to work with Patrice Abry during my post-doc at [Physics Department, ENS Lyon](http://physique.ens-lyon.fr/departement-de-physique-223870.kjsp), France.  
Prior to that, I worked as a Research and Development Engineer at Cardiology Department ([BTL Medical Technologies CZ](https://www.btlnet.com/)) and implemented signal
processing and classification algorithms for Holter and resting ECG. 

My great pleasure is to teach in Artificial Intelligence course at Department of Cybernetics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering (together with Petr Posik).
